<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As you may have noticed by the title, this project was completed for the UPS IT Intern's 2020 Hackathon. Myself, the team leader and sole developer, led our team of 4 interns in creating this web application using ASP.NET Core. Not only did we win an award for this project, it was a lot of fun to work on. We were tasked with creating a software application with business value in a little under 48 hours and our team made the Career Constructor.

The Career Constructor is a quiz-making web tool for recruiters and talent acquisition specialists to screen applicants based on relevant knowledge. It allows users to create questions, group these questions into quizzes, and assign and grade these quizzes to and from applicants. The value of this project is two-fold. One, it allows HR specialists and managers an easy way to ensure their applicants have relevant knowledge, and two, it highlights candidates with this knowledge in the interview process. The application is aimed towards interns who don't have much real-world experience but have the technical skills. By taking these quizzes they show off what they know, essentially constructing their careers.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project was written using ASP.NET Core with a local SQL database. Their were intentions to use Microsoft's Azure for the database, but we were inherently limited by time. 

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need two things: .NET Core and some type of SQL database, we used Sequel Server Management Studio.

The links for these tools can be found here:
* [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* [Sequel Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rheidem/UPS-Hackathon-2020.git
```
2. Create a database in SSMS called 'hackathon' (to interface with project)
3. Run the project
```sh
dotnet run
```
